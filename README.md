# Spotlight Demo

Attempting to get a working production prototype of [Project Blacklight](http://projectblacklight.org) + [Spotlight](https://github.com/projectblacklight/spotlight) working


## Instructions:

* Clone this [repository](https://github.com/jhriv/spotlight-demo.git)
* Bring up the vagrant instance, create ansible-required files `make all`
* Run the ansible playbook `ansible-playbook playbook.yml`


This playbook uses the ["hard way"](https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/wiki/Quickstart) to install Blacklight.
